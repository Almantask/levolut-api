# SOLID

## Idea

Currency exchange:

Api (LevolutApi) where you can exchange money of dfferent currencies:
Different banks have different rules for currency exchange fee calculation.

Api can:

- Add money to bank
- Redeem money from bank
- Exchange money from one currency to another

- Different currencies have a rate
- Exchange currency
- Exchange fee

The API has just enough complexity to showcase what problems could come from a poorly managed code base.
From a codebase that violates SOLID principles.

## S - Single Responsibility

### [Centralized Bootstrap](./Levolut.Api.V2/Bootstrap)

### [Central Error Handling](./Levolut.Api.V2/Bootstrap/ErrorHandling.cs)

### []

## O - Open-Closed

[Contracts]()

## L - Liskov Substitution



## I - Interface Segregation



## Dependency Inversion
