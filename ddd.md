# DDD

Domain Driven Design is a methodology of software development, where the model of domain drives development.
To put simply, code itself represents the business rules. We focus on code, rather than documentation, because in practice there is a tendency that the two diverge quite soon.
As new insight is gained on a domain - the code is updated with it.

## Why should you care?

### Timeless fundamentals

Technologies change rapidly, however principles stay. Even if new principles are created, they are built on top of the old ones.
OOP, SOLID, FP, DDD - every programmer should know about them for that is the fundamental basis for all software development.

20 years ago or no - all of the principles still apply.

### The freedom of choice

You don't have to code using DDD. In fact, in some scenarios it may not be suitable at all. However, you should be aware of the alternatives and pick not just the one you are comfortable with, but the one that is the most fitting for the job.
To be able to pick one, you need to understand it.

### DDD - a popular choice today

For many companies - DDD is still a popular choice today. After all, who doesn't want to simplify complex business logic?
